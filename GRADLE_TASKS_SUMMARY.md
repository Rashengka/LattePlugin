# Gradle Tasks Summary

## Tasks Tested

The following Gradle tasks were tested and verified to be working correctly:

### Basic Build Tasks
- `clean`: Deletes the build directory
- `compileJava`: Compiles Java source code
- `assemble`: Assembles the outputs of the project
- `build -x test`: Builds the project without running tests

### Testing Tasks
- `test`: Runs all unit tests

### IntelliJ Plugin-specific Tasks
- `buildPlugin`: Assembles the plugin and prepares ZIP archive for deployment
- `verifyPlugin`: Validates the plugin.xml descriptor and plugin archive structure
- `verifyPluginConfiguration`: Checks if Java compiler configuration meets IntelliJ SDK requirements

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Plugin XML Issue**: The plugin name tag was incorrectly specified as `<n>` instead of the correct `<name>`. This was fixed by updating the plugin.xml file.

2. **Plugin Verifier Configuration**: Added configuration for the `runPluginVerifier` task to specify which IDE versions to check compatibility with:
   ```gradle
   runPluginVerifier {
       ideVersions = ["2023.1.5", "2023.2", "2023.3", "2024.1"]
   }
   ```
   These versions cover the range specified in the plugin.xml file (from build 231 to 241.*).

## Tasks Not Tested

As requested, the following task was not tested:
- `publishPlugin`: This task publishes the plugin to the JetBrains Marketplace and requires additional configuration and credentials.

## Recommendations

1. **Run Plugin Verifier**: When preparing for a release, run the `runPluginVerifier` task to ensure compatibility with all supported IDE versions.

2. **Configure Publishing**: Before publishing to the JetBrains Marketplace, configure the `publishPlugin` task with the appropriate token and channel.

3. **Update Version**: Update the plugin version in build.gradle before each release.

4. **Test with Different IDE Versions**: Consider testing the plugin with different IDE versions to ensure compatibility across the supported range.
