# Changes to Unclosed Blocks Tests

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the test classes for verifying that unclosed block directives at the end of a file are automatically closed and don't trigger the "Top level element is not completed" error.

The main enhancement was to modify the `doTestUnclosedBlock` method in `LatteUnclosedBlocksTestBase.java` to accept an array of expected error descriptions and implement verification logic to ensure that:

1. All expected errors are found in the file
2. No unexpected errors are present
3. There is no "Top level element is not completed" error

## Changes Made

### 1. LatteUnclosedBlocksTestBase.java

Modified the `doTestUnclosedBlock` method to:

- Accept an array of expected error descriptions as a varargs parameter
- Verify that all expected errors are found in the file
- Verify that no unexpected errors are present
- Keep the existing check for "Top level element is not completed" error

Added an overloaded method for backward compatibility, which calls the new method with an empty array of expected errors.

### 2. Test Classes

Updated all test classes to use the new `doTestUnclosedBlock` method with expected errors:

- **LatteUnclosedConditionalBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for unclosed if, elseif, and else directives
- **LatteUnclosedExceptionBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for unclosed try and catch directives
- **LatteUnclosedContentBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for unclosed block, define, snippet, snippetArea, and capture directives
- **LatteUnclosedLoopBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for unclosed foreach, for, and while directives
- **LatteUnclosedSwitchBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for unclosed switch, case, and default directives
- **LatteUnclosedBlocksTest**: Added expected errors for multiple unclosed directives in a single file

For each test method, added:
- Expected errors for unclosed directives and HTML tags
- Updated JavaDoc comments to explain that the test now also verifies that specific expected errors are found and no unexpected errors are present
- A note that the expected errors are based on analysis of the file structure and may need to be adjusted based on actual runtime behavior

## Expected Errors

The expected errors were determined by analyzing the structure of the test files. For each test file, we identified:

1. Unclosed Latte directives (e.g., if, foreach, block)
2. Unclosed HTML tags (e.g., div)

Since we couldn't see the actual error messages from running the tests (due to the known Java runtime issue), we used generic patterns that should match part of the actual error messages:

- For unclosed Latte directives: "unclosed [directive]" (e.g., "unclosed if")
- For unclosed HTML tags: "div"

These patterns may need to be adjusted based on the actual error messages produced by the parser.

## Known Issues

The tests are expected to fail in certain test environments due to a known issue with the Java runtime method `sun.font.Font2D.getTypographicFamilyName()`. The exception occurs during test setup in `FontFamilyServiceImpl`, before the test methods are even executed.

Additionally, some tests fail with the assertion error "File should not have 'Top level element is not completed' error", which indicates that the parser is still finding this error in the file. This may be due to:

1. The implementation of the parser not correctly handling unclosed block directives
2. The expected errors not matching the actual error messages produced by the parser

In a proper environment without the Java runtime issue, and with correctly specified expected errors, the tests should pass.

## Future Improvements

1. Run the tests in a proper environment to see the actual error messages produced by the parser
2. Adjust the expected errors to match the actual error messages
3. Fix any issues with the parser implementation to ensure that unclosed block directives are correctly handled
